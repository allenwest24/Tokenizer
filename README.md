# Tokenizer
Tokenizer that will take command line entries and separate them by commands, arguments, and flags reguardless of spacing or piping.

This is a very efficient tokenizer. Follow on efforts were made to turn this into a Unix Shell. This project is found in my repositiories under the name My-Unix-Shell
